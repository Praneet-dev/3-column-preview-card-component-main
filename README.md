## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

One thing that I learnt is that since anchor tags are inline elements, specifying padding-top/bottom, margin-top/bottom or height does not affect the layout in any way. The display property for the same needs to be changed to block/inline-block to use some height on these elements.


### Continued development

While changing the window size, the elements within the column (for example the 'Learn More' link) sometimes aren't perfectly aligned in a line. It would be nice if they are always aligned whatever the width of the window.


### Useful resources

- [ Block, Inline, and Inline-Block explained | CSS Tutorial
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_i2gga-sYg&t=637s) - This helped me with understanding when to used any specific display property such as block, inline or inline block.
